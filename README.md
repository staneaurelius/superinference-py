Superinference is a library that infers analysis-ready attributes from a person's social media username or unique identifier and returns them as JSON objects.

It supports both token-based (OAuth) authorization for authenticated requests and unauthenticated requests for public data. It currently supports the following social media channels:
* GitHub
* Dev.to

It is currently actively being developed so more supported social media channels will be added in the future.

You might use superinference to generate profile pages of your app users, or to enrich your user data with additional information by inferring them from their social media accounts. You might also use it to accelerate your account creation process by directly inferring attributes such as their email address, name, and profile picture.
